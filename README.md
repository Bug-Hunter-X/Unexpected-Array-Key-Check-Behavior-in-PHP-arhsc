This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in PHP related to array key checking. The `bug.php` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.php` offers a corrected and more robust approach. The issue arises from implicit type coercion when checking for the existence of array keys using a boolean expression.  Improper handling can lead to unexpected results, especially when dealing with non-integer or non-sequential keys.  The solution provides a clearer, safer way to check for array keys, improving code reliability and maintainability.
